## üöÄ Project Overview

**SmartBin** is an IoT-powered waste management system designed to:

- **Automatically detect** types of waste (e.g., plastic, metal, organic, paper)
- **Classify trash** using machine learning and sensor data
- **Sort items** into designated compartments
- **Provide live monitoring** via cloud integration
- **Generate analytics** to improve waste habits and inform smart cities

> üõ†Ô∏è Built at the intersection of **sustainability**, **automation**, and **AI**.

## üß† How It Works

1. User disposes trash
2. Sensors detect object type and capture data
3. AI model classifies the trash using image + sensor data
4. Actuator activates sorting mechanism
5. Trash is directed to appropriate bin
6. Data is synced to cloud and visualized on dashboard
